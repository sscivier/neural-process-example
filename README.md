# neural-process-example

Example implementation of a conditional neural process for meta-learning 1-D functions.

## JAX installation

To run the Jupyter Notebook in this project, you'll need to have JAX installed. Follow the instructions [here](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Installing other dependencies

You will also need to install the following packages via `pip` or `conda`:

```
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install --upgrade numpy matplotlib equinox optax numpyro
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sscivier/neural-process-example.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Navigate to the directory containing the Jupyter Notebook

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook**: I recommend running the Jupyter notebook in VSCode:

    ```
    code .
    ```

    The first time you run the notebook, VSCode will install the required Jupyter dependencies.

    Alternatively, install the rqeuired Jupyter dependencies yourself and run:

    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```
